# Welcome to Yaff's Blog!

Here you can find my thoughts or tutorial on various topics, mostly related to web development.

## Background

For this several months, I've been working on some project. Sometimes I need to learn something new, or I just want to try something new. I've been using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as my note-taking app, and I think it's a great app. But I want to share my notes with others, and I want to make it more organized. So I decided to make this blog.

Documentation is important, so, I create this blog to share my notes, and also to make it easier for me to find my notes.
Some topics here actually just a note for myself, but I think it's worth sharing. So, I decided to make this blog. I hope you can find something useful here.
