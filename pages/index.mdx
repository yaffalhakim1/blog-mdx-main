# Welcome to Yaff's Blog!

Here you can find my thoughts or tutorial on various topics, mostly related to web development.

## Background

Over the past few months, I've been working on a project and have had to learn new things along the way. To keep track of my progress and make it easier to organize my notes, I've been using Notion as my note-taking app. While Notion is great for personal use, I wanted to share my notes with others and make them more easily accessible. So, I decided to create a blog.

Documentation is essential, and I believe that sharing my notes can be helpful for others who may be interested in similar topics. Some of the posts on this blog are personal notes, but I think they are worth sharing. I hope you find something useful here.
