# NextJS with PWA

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that provide a native app-like experience to users. If you're building a Next.js website, adding PWA support can improve the user experience and engagement.

With the next-pwa plugin, it's easy to add PWA support to your website. In this tutorial, we'll cover everything from installing the plugin and configuring the PWA manifest to registering the service worker and testing the PWA on different devices. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional PWA that your users can install on their devices and use offline. Let's get started!

This tutorial use [next-pwa](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa) by [https://github.com/shadowwalker](https://github.com/shadowwalker).

## Installing

```js copy
yarn add next-pwa
```

## Configuration

Config the PWA within your `next.config.js`

```js copy
const runtimeCaching = require("next-pwa/cache");
const withPWA = require("next-pwa")({
  dest: "public",
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development", //i usually do this because i don't need to change anything in development
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // your nextjs config
});
```

There are several config besides `dest` that you can take a look at [Configuration](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa#configuration).

After you build using `next build` this will generate `public`:`workbox-*,js` and `sw.js`

## Add Manifest file

Create a manifest.json file in your `public` folder. Make sure all the files are in `public` folder

```js copy
{
  "name": "SPDA",
  "short_name": "SPDA",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#ffffff",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/Undip.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/Undip.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Add Head Meta

Add this meta option in your `_documents.tsx`. Change it based on your needs.

```js copy
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Head>
        <meta name="application-name" content="SPDA" />
        <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
        <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="default" />
        <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="SPDA" />
        <meta name="description" content="Best PWA App in the world" />
        <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no" />
        <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
        <meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#2B5797" />
        <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight" content="no" />
        <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/touch-icon-iphone.png" />
        <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
        <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
        <link
          rel="stylesheet"
          href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500"
        />
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

## Finish

After you finish all the step above you are all set! Pop up `install` will be show when you `build` your web app.

In conclusion, adding PWA support to your Next.js website can be a great way to improve the user experience and engagement of your users. With the next-pwa plugin, it's easy to add PWA support to your project and provide a seamless user experience, even when the user is offline.
