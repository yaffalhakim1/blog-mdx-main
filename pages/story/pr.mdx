![PR](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbttnhxef/image/upload/v1682871429/233shots_so_bltena.png)

Hi, I'm Yafi, and I recently had the opportunity to contribute to the open-source project ReactJS by translating some of its pages to Indonesian language. In this post, I'll share my experience with you and explain why I think contributing to open-source projects is so valuable.

  If you want to contribute to ReactJS, you can start by translating some of its
  pages to indonesian language. You can find more information about how to do
  this in the [ReactJS Translation Guide for Indonesian
  Language](https://github.com/reactjs/id.react.dev/blob/main/TRANSLATION.md)
</Callout>

## The Process

When I decided to contribute to ReactJS, I started by researching which pages needed to be translated and what the translation guidelines were. I used online tools like Google Translate and Grammarly to help me with the translation, and I also consulted with other members of the ReactJS community to get feedback and suggestions.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring that the translations were accurate and consistent. I had to make sure that technical terms and code snippets were translated correctly, and that the tone and style of the pages remained consistent throughout. But with the help of the community, I was able to overcome these challenges and produce high-quality translations.

However, one mistake I made was not following the glossary correctly. I didn't realize how important it was to be consistent with the translations, and ended up translating some terms differently throughout the pages. This caused confusion for users who were trying to understand the translated pages.

Additionally, I also made a mistake in the way I submitted my pull request (PR). I wasn't familiar with the process, and accidentally created the PR in the wrong way. This caused some delay in the review process, and I had to work with the community members to correct my mistake.

## Insights

Through this experience, I learned a lot about the ReactJS community and open-source projects in general. I was impressed by the level of collaboration and support within the community, and I was grateful for the opportunity to learn from other contributors.

I also developed my translation and communication skills, which I know will be valuable in my future career. And perhaps most importantly, I realized that contributing to open-source projects is a great way to give back to the community and make a meaningful impact in the world.

## Impact

By translating ReactJS pages to Indonesian language, I hope to make the project more accessible to Indonesian users and help them understand the benefits and capabilities of ReactJS. I believe that open-source projects have the power to bring people together and make technology more inclusive, and I'm proud to have played a small part in that mission.

## Conclusion

Overall, my first open-source contribution to ReactJS was a challenging and rewarding experience. I encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to open-source projects to give it a try, and to remember that even small contributions can make a big difference. Thank you to the ReactJS community for welcoming me and supporting my efforts, and I look forward to contributing more in the future.
