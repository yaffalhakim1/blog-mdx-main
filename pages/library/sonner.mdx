# Sonner Toast

![Hello](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbttnhxef/image/upload/v1679486231/sonner_kvt4hk.png)

User always feel not comfortable when they see a blank page when they request something to backend. That's when toast come in. It give user a feedback that their request has been sent to backend. It also give user a feedback that their request has been success or failed.

This tutorial use [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) by [https://github.com/emilkowalski](https://github.com/emilkowalski).

## Installing

```js copy
npm install sonner
```

## Usage

Add `<Toaster />` in your `_app.tsx` or `_app.js` file besides `<Component {...pageProps} />`

```js copy
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} /> <Toaster richColors closeButton />
    </>
  );
}
```

There are several `types` of toast that you can use based on your need. Personally, i use `success` and `error` that you can take a look at [Types](https://github.com/emilkowalski/sonner#types).

`richColors` is a prop that you can use to give the toast a color based on its type. `closeButton` is a prop that you can use to show close button in toast.

this is just optional, you can use it or not.

### Success

I use this toast when user successfully request something to backend.

```js copy
toast.success("Event has been created");
```

### Error

I use this toast when user failed request something to backend.

```js copy
toast.error("Event has not been created");
```

## Example

One example i use with this toast is when user create an event. If the event has been created, i will show success toast. If the event has not been created, i will show error toast like this:

```js copy
async function handleAddSomething() {
    const options = {
     YOUR_OPTION_FOR_POST
    };
    axios
      .post("YOUR_API", options)
      .then((postFileReq) => {
        onSuccess();
        setLoading(false);
        toast.success("Event has been created");
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        const err = error as AxiosError;
        if (err.response?.status === 400) {
           toast.error("Event has not been created");
        } else {
          toast.error("Event has not been created");
        }
        setLoading(false);
             });
  }
```

## Finish

After you finish all the step above you are all set! Toast will show up when you create a new request.
